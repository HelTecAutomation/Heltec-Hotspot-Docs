#### Question: Does Heltec Indoor Hotspot support remote modification of the working frequency band?

From the feedback of our customers, we often encounter such situations:

1. I purchased the Heltec Indoor Hotspot with the AU915 frequency band, but Australia is about to use the AS923 frequency band for Helium network.
2. I am on a business trip or studying in the United States, and now I am going back home (such as Thailand, Singapore and some other Southeast Asian countries). Heltec Indoor Hotspot is my property. I hope I can take it home with me.

What should I do when a similar scenario above happens to you? You may want ask can I switch the working frequency band through the remote page?

The hardware configuration in the frequency range of 902～928MHz is the same, and the hardware configuration in the frequency range of 863～870MHz is the same. The working frequency band is realized through software configuration. **So the answer is YES**. We have implemented this feature, but it is not yet open. Before we open this function, please contact us and we will assist you to complete the remote modification.

#### Question: There is a small hole marked with R on the back of the machine. What is the purpose? Is it the reset button?

![](img/faq/04.png)

Answer: No, it's not reset button. The reset button is the power button on the front of the Heltec Indoor Hotspot. Press once to reset, long press than 4 seconds to shut down.

The button marked with "R" is used to manually flash the system firmware. The usage method will be introduced in the follow-up document.
